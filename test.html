        <h3>Book 1.</h3></br>
        So, in book one, the main cast is getting ready for bed after the halloween party. A few of them (Ace and Idia
        are
        the ones I can remember) lament the idea of getting up at 6 in the morning to clean the school from top to
        bottom.
        Riddle expresses a sense of duty and they all go off to bed eventually. Later, Ace wakes up and tells Duece to
        stop
        snoring so loud (spoiler alert he's not-'cause he's not even there!!!) and then Trey comes into the room,
        freaked
        out. Ace almost gets possesed by a ghost, but he doesn't know that, and he follows Trey to do a headcount of the
        people in Heartslaybul at the moment, where they make the horrifying discovery that half of the student body has
        simply dissapeared. Riddle laments at Cater not being there to lighten the mood and they go off to find the
        Headmage. Crowley calls a housewarden meeting(though it can hardly be called that with the coolest housewardens
        missing) and discovers that half of the students are gone. Some students are obviously a bit panicked and Vargas
        has
        some common sense for once and says that obviously they are terrified, this is scary. They plan to leave the
        school
        using the Dark Mirror, but the mirror starts glowing and sucks all the remaining students into it except for the
        ones in the main cast (Riddle, Ace, Trey, Leona, Ruggie, Floyd, Jamil, Rook, Ortho, Sebek, and Silver.) They
        freak
        out about it for a hot second and the teachers are worried and it's not good. At some point at the end of book
        one
        or the beginning of book two they make the ultimate decision that they have to go into the busted mirror.</p>

        <h3>Book 2.</h3>
        </p></br>
        They need a way to contact the teachers so they are given magical walkie talkies, and Trein talks about his
        (dead)
        wife for a good three lines. It would be sad if the conversation wasn't so heckin' goofy. Anyhow, they go into
        the
        busted up mirror and the magical walkie talkie necklaces don't work which is surprising at first, but then Ortho
        realises uh oh! They're in the Spectral Realm (the afterlife). Ruggie expresses confusion that they're there
        while
        alive and Riddle is just mad. Understandably so. The team (Riddle,Ruggie, and Ortho) get into a fight with
        ghosts
        (much to Riddle's chagrin) and realise that they should probably pick up the mirror fragments that the ghosts drop. Ruggie and Ortho introduce Riddle to the magic of adventurer stories and </p>
